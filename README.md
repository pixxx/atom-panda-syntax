## 😜

This will be a drastic change to the theme, for personal use, feel free to do whatever you like with **your copy** but I strongly suggest using the original **Panda-Syntax-Theme** *'simply read on'*. I'm just learning, total beginner !!! Noob like a bob! Barely understand anything that has to do with numbers and don't know what I'm even doing right now. I hope I don't break anyones hard work! 🤡

For now everything below still applies and will be adapted as I move on!


# 👹

Well I'm obviously getting rid of more and more things as promised. For now only worked on artwork. Hope you like the stuff made with lots of 😍 💝
