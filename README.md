This will be a drastic change to the theme, for personal use, feel free to do whatever you like with **your copy** but I strongly suggest using the original **Panda-Syntax-Theme** *'simply read on'*. I'm just learning, total beginner !!! Noob like a bob! Barely understand anything that has to do with numbers and don't know what I'm even doing right now. I hope I don't break anyones hard work! 🤡

For now everything below still applies and will be adapted as I move on!

A _Superminimal_, _dark_ Syntax Theme. This is the latest version of the **Panda Syntax** theme. It's a _dark_ syntax theme crafted especially for [Atom](http://atom.io), with subtle colors that are meant to be easy on the eyes.
