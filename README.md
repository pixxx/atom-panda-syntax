# 👹

This will be a drastic change to Atom-Panda-Syntax theme, this mostly for personal use, for now I'm still working on it as you can see and I am at the same time learning github (git cli), so that's why you see so many commits manly due to mistakes but how else should I learn.

Feel free to help or give advise, should you like what you see, I'm a designer first with very limited programming knowledge.

I strongly suggest forking from the original **Panda-Syntax-Theme** if you would like to have more serious support, I guess. I wont won't be doing any ports only using this in atom at most maybe terminal but that's for 2020 😂
